# Week 2025-06-02

## ‚úÖ Weekly To-Do
### Must Do
- Laves Phase model:
  - [x] Digitize experimental PCT plots.
  - [x] Run MC simulation for ZrV2 at T = [559, 687.5, 791.8, 894.6, 1071.6] K
  - [x] Run MC simulation for ZrMo2 at T = [373, 473, 573, 673, 781, 873, 973] K 
  - [ ] Plot PCT with Hysterisis ZrMo2 hydride.

- multicomponent BCC model 
  - [x] Mapping: Compare canonical form bitstring of CASM's mapped structures (poscar) with MADCLEX mapped structures. (Different canonical_form, if mapping cost is very different) 
  - [ ] Prepare data for training, validation, testing data (80-10-10)
  - Ladder training:
    - [ ] What is a ladder step?
    - [ ] When does it converged and move to the next?
  - [ ] Plot learning curves: train, validation and testing errors vs number of training_data points for embedding dimension of metal sublattice = [2, 3]
  - [ ] Compare linear model computed with MADCLEX and CASM.
- [ ] Set up meeting with Berend #work #due:2025-06-30

### Should Do
- [ ] Lenker's script: Neural Networks.
- [ ] Read embedded Cluster Expansion paper.

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Write Annual report  #work #due:2025-06-30
- [ ] Write Code that takes original chemical potential values in free energy integration.
